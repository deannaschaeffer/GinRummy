We measured the lines of code in our directory using the VSCodeCounter tool. 
This determined that there are 2962 lines of ocaml code in our directory (not
including comments). 

After subtracting the 1358 lines of ocaml code in the test.ml file as well as 
the 76 lines of ocaml code that are essentially just strings representing the 
rules (in files gui.ml and main.ml), this leaves us with 1528 lines of code.
